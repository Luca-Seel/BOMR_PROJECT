    "# **INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "This is the project associated with the class \"Basics of Mobile Robotics\", in which the goal is to use and implement various algorithm and robitics techniques seen in class with a Thymio robot, more precisely global & local navigation, computer vision, sensor filtering and motion control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Objectifs \n",
    "The goal of this project is to use the Thymio robot and a camera to : \n",
    "- Create a map of an environment \n",
    "- Detect the starting position and target position in the environemnt\n",
    "- Calculate a global path\n",
    "- Move the robot towards the target location while avoiding obstacles (permanent and movable) \n",
    "- Be insensitive to Kidnapping and camera obscuring \n",

    "For the environment, we chose to have a large white paper sheet with black obstacles to be less sensitive to lighting condition. The only conditions we set on the obstacles where that they are not an isosceles triangle nor round since those shapes are reserved respectively for the robot and the end goal.  We also consider the borders of the sheet as obstacles so that the robot never exists the environement. Local obstacles are defined in various sizes and shapes, like square or round objects.\n",

    "## Global Navigation \n",
    "For the global navigation, we decided to keep it as simple as possible while having decent performances. For that, the most modular and performant algorithm was A*, since complexity can easily be controlled by the intricacy of the motion cost, while guranteeing fast path calculations, especially if set as depth first. \n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, we decided to have a grid map, using every pixel of the image as cell, and the center of the robot as reference point. To account for the fact that our robot is just a point, we increase the size of the obstacles by using the `distance_transform_edt` function for the `scipy.ndimage` library. What it does is it assigns to every cell in a grid that is non-zero the distance to the closest zero cell, that way if the cell is too close to an obstacle, we count it as such."

    "# Extended Kalman Filter\n",
    "A Kalman filter takes a prediction of the state based on the motion model and it adds process noise with covariance Q. This prediction step is corrected by the results of a measurement, which is trusted to a certain degree, as noise with the covariance R on the sensor is assumed. Therefore, it is a powerful filter with only a simple model to store and the parameters Q and R to tune. In this project an extended Kalman filter is used, as the motion model is non-linear and has to be linearized in each step. \n",

The velocities are divided in translational and rotational as that enhances understandability compared to the separate velocities of the wheels.\n",

    "Proportional control is used to achieve the right turn velocity $\\omega = K * (desiredAngle - filteredAngle)$, which is applied to both wheels with different signs. The maximum turning velocity is clipped to $\\omega_{max}$, to prevent the robot from turning too fast.\n",
